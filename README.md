# whoami
Student of mathematics at the University of Strasbourg, France. I mainly do video games and financial tools for backtesting.

I hope pushing more and more projects, don't really have the habit of doing so.
Currently developping a finance tool for asynchroneous time series, a game about building space ships and a plant caring mobile game.
Both soon available I hope !
