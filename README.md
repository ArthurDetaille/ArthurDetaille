Studend of mathematics at the University of Strasbourg, France. I mainly do video games and financial tools for backtesting.

I hope pushing more and more projects, don't really have the habit of doing so.
Currently developping a finance tool for non-synchroneous time series and a game about building space ships.
Both soon available I hope !
